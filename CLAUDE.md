# CLAUDE.md — Report Builder Project Intelligence

## Project overview

**Report Builder** is a local-only, offline web application for building stylish 16:9 presentation-style PDF reports. It targets the Ukrainian Ministry of Digital Transformation. No backend, no network calls, no cloud deployment. The output is a `dist/` folder that opens directly in Chrome via `file://` protocol.

## Tech stack

| Layer | Technology | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Build | Vite 6+ | `npm run build` → static `dist/` folder |
| Framework | React 18 + TypeScript | Strict mode, functional components only |
| UI library | Ant Design 5 | Builder interface (not PDF output) |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS 3 | Custom theming for PDF slide output |
| Charts | Chart.js 4 + react-chartjs-2 | Bar, donut, line charts |
| Gantt | Custom SVG renderer | No library — matches specific design reference |
| Choropleth | D3.js + Ukraine GeoJSON | Oblast-level map with data-driven fills |
| Grid layout | react-grid-layout v2 | Drag/resize tiles on slide canvas |
| PDF export | html2canvas + jsPDF | Render slides at 1920x1080 → assemble PDF |
| i18n | i18next + react-i18next | UA/EN toggle |
| Font | e-Ukraine (bundled .woff2) | Official MinDigit typeface, Cyrillic-first |

## Architecture principles

- **No network calls.** The app must function entirely offline. No CDN imports at runtime, no analytics, no telemetry. All libraries are bundled.
- **`file://` compatible output.** The `dist/` folder must work when opened directly in Chrome without a server. Use relative paths only. No absolute URLs. Test with `file://` after every build.
- **Separation of concerns.** Builder UI logic (React/Ant Design) is completely separate from slide rendering logic (Canvas/SVG for PDF). Slide renderers must be pure functions: `(slideData, theme) => HTMLElement`.
- **Type everything.** No `any` types. All slide data, chart configs, theme objects, and layout positions have explicit TypeScript interfaces.

## SOLID principles — mandatory, not optional

Every piece of code written or modified must conform to all five SOLID principles. These are hard requirements, not guidelines.

### S — Single Responsibility Principle
Each module, component, hook, or function does exactly one thing and has exactly one reason to change.

- A component renders UI. It does not fetch data, format strings, or compute derived values inline.
- A hook encapsulates one behavior (e.g. `useUndoRedo` manages undo/redo; it does not also manage selection).
- A service function does one transformation (e.g. `csvParser` parses CSV; it does not also validate chart config).
- **Violation signal:** a function/component name contains "and" or "or", or a file exceeds 150 lines.

### O — Open/Closed Principle
Code is open for extension, closed for modification. Add new behavior by adding new code, not by editing existing stable code.

- New slide types are added by creating a new file in `components/slides/` and registering in a map — never by adding another `if/else` branch inside existing renderers.
- New chart types extend `ChartType` union and get a new component in `components/charts/` — not a new `switch` arm in an existing chart component.
- New theme presets are new files in `themes/` — not new branches in `ThemeColors` resolution logic.
- **Violation signal:** adding a feature requires modifying 3+ existing files that previously worked correctly.

### L — Liskov Substitution Principle
Any implementation of an interface or abstract shape must be fully substitutable without breaking callers.

- All slide data types implement `SlideData` fully — no `type` field can be conditionally absent.
- Chart components must accept the same props interface and render without crashing when given valid but minimal data (e.g. empty `points` array).
- Hooks that return `null` must be explicitly typed as `T | null` — callers must not need to know the implementation to handle absence.
- **Violation signal:** a caller does `instanceof` checks or type-narrows on a concrete implementation class rather than using the discriminated union.

### I — Interface Segregation Principle
No module should be forced to depend on interfaces it does not use. Keep interfaces narrow and composable.

- Component props interfaces include only what that component needs — no passing a full `Report` object when only `report.theme` is needed.
- Hooks return only what callers need — `useSelectedSlide` returns `Slide | null`, not the entire `UndoableState`.
- Do not create a single `utils.ts` barrel file — split by domain (`formatters.ts`, `constants.ts`, etc.).
- **Violation signal:** a component receives a large object prop but only destructures one or two fields from it.

### D — Dependency Inversion Principle
High-level modules must not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

- `reportReducer` depends on `Report`, `Slide`, `TileConfig` interfaces — not on concrete component implementations.
- `pdfExport.ts` accepts a `HTMLElement` — it does not import React components or call `ReactDOM.render`.
- Services (`csvParser`, `slideFactory`, `pdfExport`) have zero React imports — they are pure TypeScript functions.
- Test files inject dependencies via parameters or mocks — no hard-coded imports of singletons inside tested functions.
- **Violation signal:** a service file imports from `react`, `antd`, or any UI component.

## Design-first protocol — required before any non-trivial implementation

For any change that touches more than one file or introduces a new abstraction, answer these three questions **before opening any source file to write code**. If you cannot answer all three in one sentence each, stop and redesign until you can.

**1. Single responsibility:** What is the one thing this function, hook, or component does? Write it as a sentence. If the sentence contains "and", redesign.

**2. Interface first:** What is the public contract — the TypeScript signature, props type, or hook return type? Write it out as types before writing any implementation body. Ask: does every caller need every field I'm exposing? If not, narrow it.

**3. Testability:** How will I test this in isolation? If the answer requires a full React tree, a real DOM, or a running server, the design has a dependency problem. Redesign until the core logic can be called as a plain function with plain inputs.

Only after answering all three should you write implementation. Tests written before implementation are not a formality — they confirm that the interface is actually usable.

## When NOT to apply the rules — judgment over mechanical compliance

Rules applied mechanically without judgment produce worse code than no rules at all. The following counterweights are as mandatory as the rules themselves.

### Do not extract an abstraction for fewer than three real callsites

One callsite: inline it. Two callsites: duplicate it (leave a `// NOTE: similar to X in Y.ts — extract if a third callsite appears` comment so the duplication is visible). Three callsites: extract, because now you have enough evidence to understand the genuine shared boundary.

The first abstraction is always a guess. Two similar-looking things are often coincidentally similar and will diverge under different requirements. Premature unification creates coupling that is expensive to undo.

### Do not split a component because it hit 150 lines

Split on **concerns**, not on line count. A 170-line component with exactly one reason to change and one level of abstraction is better than two 85-line components that must communicate through callbacks, adding coupling that didn't exist before. The line limit is a warning signal — investigate whether multiple concerns are present; don't split automatically.

### Do not apply OCP to unstable code

OCP protects **stable** code from modification. Early in a feature's life, when requirements are still evolving, premature extension points add complexity with no benefit. Inline the logic first. Extract the extension point once the shape of variation is clear and the code is stable. The wrong abstraction is harder to remove than duplicated code.

### Do not use context when props are sufficient

Context adds indirection that makes data flow harder to trace. Use props when a value travels one level. Use context when a value is needed by many components at different nesting depths, and passing it through intermediate components would force those intermediates to know about data they do not use.

### Do not memoize speculatively

`useMemo` and `useCallback` add cognitive overhead and can mask bugs by hiding dependency changes. Use them only when: (a) a computation is measurably expensive, or (b) a reference is passed to a memoised child and its instability is causing unnecessary re-renders you have confirmed with profiling. Do not memoize "just in case".

### When deviating from a rule is correct

Write a comment immediately above the deviation:
```typescript
// Intentional exception to [rule name]: [one-sentence justification]
```
This makes the deviation visible during review and prevents it from being silently copied elsewhere.

## Key data model

```typescript
// Core types — these drive everything
interface Report {
  slides: Slide[];
  theme: ThemePreset;
  language: 'ua' | 'en';
}

type SlideType = 'title' | 'chart' | 'divider' | 'text' | 'ending';

interface Slide {
  id: string;
  type: SlideType;
  data: SlideData;          // Discriminated union by type
  tiles?: TileConfig[];     // Only for 'chart' type slides
}

interface TileConfig {
  id: string;
  type: ChartType | 'text';
  layout: GridLayout;       // x, y, w, h for react-grid-layout
  data: ChartData | TextData;
  options: ChartOptions;
}

type ChartType = 'bar-v' | 'bar-h' | 'donut' | 'line' | 'gantt' | 'choropleth' | 'data-table';

// Undo/redo — wraps the report state with history
interface UndoableState {
  past: Report[];       // Previous states (max 50 entries)
  present: Report;      // Current state
  future: Report[];     // States undone (cleared on new action)
  selectedSlideId: string | null;
  selectedTileId: string | null;
}

// Actions that modify report content push to history.
// UI-only actions (SELECT_SLIDE, SELECT_TILE, SET_LANGUAGE) do NOT push to history.
// SET_THEME DOES push to history (it changes the report output).
```

## Best practices — non-negotiable standards

These apply to every file touched, regardless of task scope. Following them is not optional.

> **Understanding the "why":** The key architectural decisions and their reasoning are summarized inline in `AGENTS.md` under "Key architectural decisions". `DECISIONS.md` contains the extended version of the same reasoning for engineers who want more depth. When a rule feels arbitrary or a situation isn't covered, start there.

### Code correctness
- **Read before writing.** Never modify a file without reading it first. Understand the existing structure before proposing changes.
- **Immutability by default.** State is never mutated. Use spread, `map`, `filter`, `slice` for all updates. The `reportReducer` tests enforce this.
- **Pure functions wherever possible.** Functions with no side effects are preferred. Side effects are isolated to hooks, context, and services.
- **Fail loudly.** Do not swallow errors silently. Unhandled promise rejections must be caught and reported. Missing required data should throw, not return `undefined` silently.
- **Exhaustive switches.** Every `switch` on a discriminated union must cover all variants. TypeScript's `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch` enforces this at compile time — do not add `default` as an escape hatch.

### TypeScript strictness
- Zero `any`. If a type is unknown, use `unknown` and narrow explicitly.
- Zero `as X` type casts unless crossing a genuine system boundary (e.g. DOM API). Every cast must have a comment explaining why it is safe.
- Explicit return types on all exported functions and hooks.
- Prefer `interface` for object shapes, `type` for unions and aliases.
- Discriminated unions are preferred over optional fields. `SlideData` is a discriminated union — do not add `type?: SlideType` optional fields.
- No `!` non-null assertions. Narrow with `if` guards or use the nullish coalescing operator.

### React-specific
- Functional components only. No class components.
- Every `useEffect` must have a correct dependency array. ESLint's `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` enforces this — fix the warning, do not disable it.
- `useMemo` and `useCallback` are used for expensive computations and stable references passed to child components. They are not used speculatively.
- Key props on lists must be stable, unique IDs — never array index.
- Do not read from context in components that render inside a hot loop (e.g. inside a tile grid). Derive data in the parent and pass it down.

### Anti-pattern identification and mandatory refactoring

When working on any task, if the following anti-patterns are encountered in touched files, **they must be fixed** in the same PR as a separate commit with the `refactor:` prefix. Do not leave known anti-patterns behind.

| Anti-pattern | What to do instead |
|---|---|
| God component (>150 lines, multiple concerns) | Split into focused sub-components and hooks |
| Prop drilling (>2 levels deep) | Lift to context or use composition |
| Inline object/array literals in JSX props | Extract to `useMemo` or module-level constant |
| Boolean prop flags controlling render variants (`isLarge`, `isError`) | Use discriminated union props or separate components |
| `useEffect` for derived state | Compute inline or with `useMemo`; `useEffect` is for synchronisation only |
| Direct DOM manipulation inside React components | Use refs with careful scoping; prefer declarative rendering |
| `any` or type cast in a data path | Introduce a proper interface or type guard |
| Business logic inside a component body | Extract to a hook or service function |
| Magic number or magic string inline | Move to `src/utils/constants.ts` with a named export |
| Multiple `useState` for related data | Combine into one `useReducer` or a single state object |
| Duplicate logic in 2+ components | Extract to a shared hook or utility |
| `console.log` left in committed code | Remove; use error boundaries for runtime errors |

## Code quality rules

### Formatting and linting
- **Prettier** runs on every file before commit. Config: single quotes, no semicolons, 100 char line width, trailing commas.
- **ESLint** with `@typescript-eslint/recommended` + `react-hooks/recommended`. Zero warnings policy.
- **Before every commit:** Run `npm run format && npm run lint && npm run test`.
- **Before every push:** CI runs the same checks. Failing CI blocks merge.

### Testing
- **Vitest** for unit and component tests.
- **Coverage target:** 80%+ on `services/`, `store/`, and `utils/`.
- **What to test:**
  - `reportReducer` — every action type with edge cases
  - `csvParser` — various CSV/TSV formats, malformed input, empty input
  - `slideFactory` — default data for each slide type
  - `pdfExport` — mock html2canvas/jsPDF, test pipeline orchestration
  - Chart components — render with sample data, no runtime errors
- **What NOT to test:** Ant Design internals, react-grid-layout drag mechanics.

### Naming conventions
- Components: PascalCase (`BarChart.tsx`)
- Hooks: camelCase with `use` prefix (`useReport.ts`)
- Types/interfaces: PascalCase (`ChartConfig`)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`SLIDE_WIDTH`)
- Files match their default export name

### Git practices
- Conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`
- One logical change per commit
- Branch per milestone: `feat/phase-1-shell`, `feat/phase-2-charts`, etc.

## CI/CD pipeline (.github/workflows/ci.yml)

```yaml
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with: { node-version: 20 }
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run format:check
      - run: npm run lint
      - run: npm run typecheck
      - run: npm run test -- --run
      - run: npm run build
```

## Common pitfalls to avoid

1. **Don't import from CDN at runtime.** All libraries must be in `node_modules` and bundled by Vite. The app runs offline.
2. **Don't use `position: fixed` in slide renderers.** Slides are rendered to canvas for PDF — fixed positioning breaks html2canvas.
3. **Don't use CSS `calc()` in slide renderers.** html2canvas has limited support. Use explicit pixel values.
4. **Don't forget `file://` testing.** After `npm run build`, open `dist/index.html` directly in Chrome. If anything breaks, the build is wrong.
5. **Don't use `localStorage`.** The app has no persistence by design.
6. **Don't hardcode Ukrainian/English strings.** Everything user-facing goes through i18next, even if it seems small.
7. **Chart.js renders to `<canvas>` which html2canvas handles well.** But D3 renders to SVG — test that the choropleth map exports correctly to PDF.
8. **react-grid-layout v2 is TypeScript-native.** Don't install `@types/react-grid-layout` — it conflicts.

## Mandatory post-task code audit

After completing any task, run this checklist against all files touched in the task. This is not optional — incomplete audits are a reason to not merge.

**If any item is found violated, fix it.** Fixes go in a separate commit with the `refactor:` prefix. Do not bundle refactoring with feature commits.

### Correctness
- [ ] No `any` types introduced
- [ ] No `as X` casts without an explanatory comment
- [ ] No `!` non-null assertions
- [ ] All `switch` statements on discriminated unions are exhaustive
- [ ] No unhandled promise rejections; PDF export pipeline has try/catch
- [ ] No silent `undefined` returns where the caller expects a value

### Design
- [ ] No component exceeds 150 lines — split if so
- [ ] No prop drilling deeper than 2 levels — use context or composition
- [ ] No duplicate logic across 2+ files — extract a hook or utility
- [ ] No `useEffect` used for derived state computation
- [ ] No business logic inside JSX or component render bodies
- [ ] No inline object/array literals in JSX props (creates new references every render)

### Code hygiene
- [ ] No dead code: unused imports, unreachable branches, commented-out blocks
- [ ] No magic numbers or magic strings — all in `src/utils/constants.ts`
- [ ] No `console.log` statements
- [ ] File names match their default export (PascalCase for components, camelCase for hooks/utils)

### Project constraints
- [ ] No hardcoded UI strings — all through i18next
- [ ] No `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, or `IndexedDB` usage
- [ ] No runtime CDN imports — all dependencies in `node_modules`
- [ ] Services (`services/`) have zero React imports
- [ ] No `position: fixed` or CSS `calc()` in slide renderer components

### Accessibility
- [ ] Form inputs have associated `<label>` elements
- [ ] Interactive elements are keyboard-navigable
- [ ] Custom controls have appropriate ARIA attributes
